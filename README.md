# Destiny 2 Catalyst Tracker & AI Assistant

A modern web and desktop tool for tracking Destiny 2 catalysts, featuring an AI assistant with Destiny character personas, emoji-rich responses, and deep integration with Bungie.net and community Google Sheets.

---

## Features
- **AI Chat Assistant**: Ask questions about catalysts, weapons, and Destiny 2 using natural language.
- **Persona System**: Choose from Destiny characters (Saint-14, Cayde-6, Ikora, etc.) for unique, emoji-filled responses.
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Pulls curated weapon and endgame data from public and private Google Sheets (service account support).
- **Session Longevity**: JWT refresh endpoint keeps you logged in for 24h+ without repeated Bungie logins.
- **Frontend Persona Dropdown**: Instantly switch the agent's personality in the chat UI.
- **Secure Token Handling**: Refresh tokens and sensitive credentials are never exposed to the frontend or committed to git.
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Modern, responsive UI for desktop and mobile.
- **Cross-Platform**: Web (React + FastAPI) and legacy desktop (Python CLI) versions.

## Quick Start (Web App)

### 1. Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/destiny2-catalyst-tracker.git
cd destiny2-catalyst-tracker
cd web-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
- **Backend:**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Frontend:**
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  ```

### 3. Google Sheets API Setup (for Endgame Analysis)
- Create a Google Cloud project and enable the Sheets API.
- Download your `service_account.json` and place it in `web_app/backend/`.
- **Share** the relevant Google Sheets with your service account email.
- **Never commit** `service_account.json` (it's in `.gitignore`).

### 4. SSL Certificates (for HTTPS)
- Install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation) and run:
  ```bash
  mkcert -cert-file web_app/cert.pem -key-file web_app/key.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
  ```

### 5. Run Backend
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn web_app.backend.main:app --reload --ssl-keyfile=web_app/key.pem --ssl-certfile=web_app/cert.pem --port 8000
```

### 6. Run Frontend
```bash
cd web_app/frontend
npm start
```

## Persona System
- Select your favorite Destiny character in the chat UI dropdown (Saint-14, Cayde-6, Ikora, Saladin, Zavala, Eris Morn, Shaxx, Drifter, Mara Sov).
- The AI assistant will respond in that character's style, using relevant Destiny-themed emojis liberally (e.g., üõ°Ô∏è, üêî, ‚ú®, ü™ñ).
- Persona selection is sent with each chat request and dynamically changes the agent's system prompt.

---

## Google Sheets Integration
- The backend uses a Google service account to access public and shared Destiny 2 spreadsheets.
- Sheets are used for:
  - **Endgame Analysis**: Dynamic sheet discovery, fuzzy sheet name matching, and caching.
  - **PvE BiS Lists**: Community-curated weapon recommendations by type and activity.
- Sheet data is cached for performance and freshness.
- **Sensitive files** (`service_account.json`, `credentials.json`) are never committed and are listed in `.gitignore`.

---

## Session & Authentication Flow
- **OAuth2 with Bungie.net**: Secure login, access token (1h), refresh token (90d, backend only).
- **JWT (24h)**: Issued to frontend for API calls. When expired, the frontend calls `/auth/refresh` to get a new JWT (no Bungie login required if refresh token is valid).
- **No more repeated logins**: As long as your refresh token is valid, you stay logged in for days.
- **Sensitive tokens** are never sent to the frontend or stored in git.

---

## Security & Sensitive Files
- **Never commit** `service_account.json`, `credentials.json`, or any private keys. These are in `.gitignore` by default.
- If you see these files in `git status`, remove them from staging with `git reset` or `git rm --cached`.
- Share your Google Sheet with the service account email, not your personal account.

---

## Development & Testing
- **Backend tests:**
  ```bash
  cd web_app/backend
  source venv/bin/activate
  pytest
  ```
- **Frontend tests:**
  ```bash
  cd web_app/frontend
  npm test
  ```

## Legacy Desktop App
- See `desktop-app/README.md` for CLI usage.

## Troubleshooting
- **Bungie login loop?** Make sure your backend is running with HTTPS and your JWT/refresh logic is up to date.
- **Google Sheets errors?** Ensure your service account is shared on the sheet and the file is not committed.
- **Persona not working?** Make sure you're selecting a persona in the chat UI and the backend is restarted after updates.
