- **Do NOT Suggest or Question What’s Just Been Discussed**
  - If we’ve recently discussed, edited, or clarified a file or a specific code section, do not re-suggest, re-question, or make assumptions about that same area for a set period (e.g., the last 10 interactions).
  - **Never reference, question, or re-litigate** backend changes after we move on to frontend or other areas—unless explicitly requested.
  - Avoid blanket suggestions based on file scan or global context if those parts have already been handled in this session.

  - **Examples:**
    - ✅ DO: Only reference backend logic if *specifically* asked after moving on to frontend.
    - ❌ DON'T: After backend edits are completed and we move to frontend, don’t say, “Maybe your backend needs X,” if we already fixed/discussed that.

  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Move forward with new context only
  // (No backend suggestions unless explicitly asked)
  editFrontendComponent();

  // ❌ DON'T: Bring up backend issues after recent edits/discussion
  maybeYouShouldEditBackend(); // ← Not helpful, already discussed!
